                My name is Brodie and I am an aspiring software engineer and cyber security analyst. 
                I have been coding for about a year now and I can program in multiple languages. Some of these languages include Python, Javascript, Java, and C#. 
                I first learned how to code through a python course I took as a child but ended up quitting. 
                After this I decided I wanted to learn programming again so I applied to a STEM academy near me. 
                I spent my freshman year at the STEM academy taking a fundamentals class. 
                After I completed this class I was able to take an intro to programming class. 
                The class stated us out with Java but then moved into unity where we used C#. 
                At the end of the class I ended up liking programming so much I continued to program even after the class was over. 
                This is how I learned python and javascript. 
                After I learned basic javascript, HTML, and CSS I started to learn React which is what this website is made with.
